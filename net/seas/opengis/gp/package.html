    <P ALIGN="justify">Grid coverage processing implementation. The following is
    adapted from <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/techno/specs/">OpenGIS® Grid
    Coverages Implementation Specification</A>:</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#008060">
    <P ALIGN="justify">This optional interface provides operations for different
    ways of accessing the grid coverage values as well as image processing
    functionality. The list of available processing operations is implementation
    dependent. The interface has a discovery mechanism to determine the available
    processing operations. These processing operations will transform values
    within a single sample dimension, and leave the values in other sample
    dimensions unaffected. The modified sample dimension may also change its
    type (e.g. from <CODE>4BIT</CODE> to <CODE>1BIT</CODE>). The actual
    underlying grid data remains unchanged. The interface has been designed to
    allow the adaptations to be done in a "pipe-lined" manner. The interface
    operates on {@link net.seas.opengis.gc.GridCoverage} to create a new 
    {@link net.seas.opengis.gc.GridCoverage}. The interface does not need to
    make a copy of the source grid data. Instead, it can return a grid coverage
    object which applies the adaptations on the original grid coverage whenever
    a block of data is requested. In this way, a pipeline of several grid
    coverages can be constructed cheaply.</P>

    <P ALIGN="justify">This interface can perform any of the following:</P>

    <OL>
      <LI>Change the number of bands being accessed.</LI>
      <LI>Change the value sequencing in which the grid values are retrieved.</LI>
      <LI>Allow re-sampling of the grid coverage for a different geometry.
          Creating a new {@link net.seas.opengis.gc.GridCoverage} with different
          grid geometry allows for reprojecting the grid coverage to another
          projection and another georeferencing type, resampling to another cell
          resolution and subsetting the grid coverage.</LI>
      <LI>Modify the way the grid values are accessed (filtered, classified...).</LI>
      <LI>Change the interpolation method used when evaluating points which fall
          between grid cells.</LI>
      <LI>Filtering</LI>
      <LI>Image enhancements.</LI>
      <LI>etc.</LI>
    </OL>

    <P ALIGN="justify">Note: the <CODE>GridAnalysis</CODE> class
    is intentionnaly omitted. <CODE>GridAnalysis</CODE> methods
    have been moved into {@link net.seas.opengis.cv.SampleDimension}.
