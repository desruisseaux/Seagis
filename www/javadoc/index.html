          This package contains a fair amount of classes (not all OpenGIS-related),
          requires JDK 1.4 and the generic compiler.</p></li>

      <li><p ALIGN="justify"><a HREF="seagis">Browse the <em>seagis</em> package</a>.
          This package contains only selected classes from the experimental package,
          scaled down to JDK 1.3 without generic compiler. This is the package you
          should use if you are looking for a stable API. This is also the package
          discussed in the <a HREF="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/seagis-discuss">Discussion
          list</a>.</p></li>

      <li><p ALIGN="justify"><a HREF="opengis">Browse OpenGIS specification</a>.
          This package contains a copy of OpenGIS Javadoc. <strong>Note: API
          published there is slightly different from the one currently available
          on <a HREF="http://www.opengis.org/techno/specs/">OpenGIS web site</a>,
          in that most methods are declared to throw <code>RemoteException</code>.
          This detail seem to have been forgotten in the original OpenGIS's
          interfaces, but we don't know if and when it will be fixed.</strong></p></li>
