# Seagis archive

This is a copy of the [Seagis project](https://seagis.sourceforge.net/) CVS repository converted to Git.
The Seagis project [started in August 2001](https://github.com/desruisseaux/Seagis/commit/3f56d39c38b7e69535cb2a1ae36c621ddbf7d95d)
and was the early home of referencing and core coverage (excluding I/O) modules before their
[donation to GeoTools 2](https://github.com/desruisseaux/Seagis/commit/6757ff50f8d79d159aa9394ad412d0a75a8cd162) in June 2002.
It also included a statefull renderer.

After a few years in GeoTools, the development continues
as the [Apache SIS](https://sis.apache.org) project.
