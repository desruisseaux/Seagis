  <BODY>
    <P ALIGN="justify">Provides implementation for general positioning, coordinate
    systems, and coordinate transformations. SEAGIS is an open source implementation
    of a subset of <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/techno/specs/">OpenGIS® Coordinate
    Transformation Services Specification</A> and <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/techno/specs/">OpenGIS®
    Grid Coverages Specification</A>. Being OpenGIS-compliant should allow developers
    to switch between this free implementation and any commercial implementation with
    no code change (providing that commercial implementations are OpenGIS compliant).</P>

    <H2><A NAME="packages_organization">Packages organization</A></H2>
    <P ALIGN="justify">A SEAGIS's goal is to ensure interoperability with standard
    Java packages like <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/2D/">Java2D</A> and
    <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/">Java Advanced Imaging</A>.
    However, it is not always possible to leverage Java classes and be OpenGIS-compliant
    in the same time. SEAGIS workaround the problem by providing two sets of packages:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>The <CODE>org.opengis</CODE> package is the standard OpenGIS specification. Classes
          in this package are mostly interfaces, with no implementation. Interfaces defined
          there are well suited for RMI use, which implies that every method is declared to
          throws {@link java.rmi.RemoteException}. <FONT color="#008040">Developers looking
          for strict OpenGIS compliance and/or RMI use should look at this <CODE>org.opengis</CODE>
          package.</FONT><BR>&nbsp;</LI>

      <LI>The <CODE>net.seas.opengis</CODE> package is an <CODE>org.opengis</CODE> mirror tuned
          for Java and local use. It contains concrete classes (not interfaces). There is generally
          a 1 to 1 correspondence between OpenGIS interfaces and SEAGIS classes, so developers
          familiar with one package should be familiar with the other. SEAGIS methods do not thrown
          <CODE>RemoteException</CODE>, which make them easier for local use but is not suitable for
          RMI use. <FONT color="#008040">Developers looking for
          <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/2D/">Java2D</A> interoperability and/or
          local use may look at this <CODE>net.seas.opengis</CODE> package.</FONT><BR>&nbsp;</LI>
    </UL>

    <P ALIGN="justify">Factory classes allow the creation of OpenGIS objects (RMI enabled)
    backed by SEAGIS classes. Internally, interoperability between OpenGIS interfaces and
    SEAGIS classes is assured through a set of RMI-aware adapters. Classes not related to
    any OpenGIS API appear in separated packages (e.g. <CODE>net.seas.map</CODE>) and
    sub-packages.</P>

    list of differences between SEAGIS's API and OpenGIS specification</A>.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <H3>Note about <CODE>fr.ird</CODE> packages</H3>
    <P ALIGN="justify">The <CODE>fr.ird</CODE> branch contains experimental classes
    needed for some work at IRD (Institut de Recherche pour le Développement, France).
    It can be seen as an example of use of <CODE>net.seas</CODE> packages. Note that
    <STRONG>the <CODE>net.seas</CODE> branch has no dependencies to <CODE>fr.ird</CODE></STRONG>.
    Consequently, the whole <CODE>fr</CODE> directory and sub-directories can be deleted
    (if you want) without any impact on the OpenGIS implementation in <CODE>net.seas</CODE>.</P>
