    <P ALIGN="justify">Provides implementation for general positioning, coordinate
    systems, and coordinate transformations. SEAGIS is an open source implementation
    of a subset of <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/techno/specs/">OpenGIS® Coordinate
    Transformation Services Specification</A> and <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/techno/specs/">OpenGIS®
    Grid Coverages Specification</A>. Being OpenGIS-compliant should allow developers
    to switch between this free implementation and any commercial implementation with
    no code change (providing that commercial implementations are OpenGIS compliant).</P>

    <P ALIGN="justify">A SEAGIS's goal is to ensure interoperability with standard
    Java packages like <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/2D/">Java2D</A> and
    <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/">Java Advanced Imaging</A>.
    However, it is not always possible to leverage Java classes and be OpenGIS-compliant
    in the same time. SEAGIS workaround the problem by providing two sets of packages:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>The <CODE>org.opengis</CODE> package is the standard OpenGIS specification. Classes
          in this package are mostly interfaces, with no implementation. Interfaces defined
          there are well suited for RMI use, which implies that every method is declared to
          throws {@link java.rmi.RemoteException}. <FONT color="#008040">Developers looking
          for strict OpenGIS compliance and/or RMI use should look at this <CODE>org.opengis</CODE>
          package.</FONT><BR>&nbsp;</LI>

      <LI>The <CODE>net.seagis</CODE> package is an <CODE>org.opengis</CODE> mirror tuned
          for Java and local use. It contains concrete classes (not interfaces). There is
          generally a 1 to 1 correspondence between OpenGIS interfaces and SEAGIS classes,
          so developers familiar with one package should be familiar with the other. SEAGIS
          methods do not thrown <CODE>RemoteException</CODE>, which make them easier for
          local use but is not suitable for RMI use. <FONT color="#008040">Developers looking
          for <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/2D/">Java2D</A> interoperability
          and/or local use may look at this <CODE>net.seagis</CODE> package.</FONT><BR>&nbsp;</LI>
    </UL>

    <P ALIGN="justify">Factory classes allow the creation of OpenGIS objects (RMI enabled)
    backed by SEAGIS classes. Internally, interoperability between OpenGIS interfaces and
    SEAGIS classes is assured through a set of RMI-aware adapters.</P>
