    <P ALIGN="justify">Private package for utilities classes. This package is
    used internally by some classes in public packages. <strong>Do not use
    classes in this <code>fr.ird.resources</code> package</strong>. Classes in
    this package may change in incompatible ways in any future version. Most
    classes are just workaround for some Java shortcoming. They will be removed
    when a more standard approach will be available.</P>
